## v1.0.7

- **Network Interruption & Auto-Recovery**:
  - Implemented continuous background auto-recovery retry (15s periodic cycle) when initial backoff retries are exhausted due to network loss.
  - Ads automatically recover and preload into memory as soon as network connectivity is restored without requiring manual re-initialization.
  - Added robust exception handling across all ad format catch blocks (`RewardAd`, `InterAd`, `RewardInterAd`, `AppOpenAdManager`, `LoadBannerAd`, `BaseNativeAdLoader`).
- **Rewarded Interstitial Format Integration**:
  - Added full preloading and management support for **Rewarded Interstitial Ads** via `RewardInterAd` and `showRewardedInterstitialAd(...)`.
- **Collapsible & Standard Banner Modularization**:
  - Introduced `ShowCollapsibleBannerAd` for dedicated, dynamic collapsible banner ad display.
  - Added strongly-typed `CollapsibleBannerPosition` enum (`bottom` and `top`) replacing string literals.
  - Added `FittedBox(fit: BoxFit.contain)` responsive layout container to scale standard and collapsible banners seamlessly inside parent constraints.
- **Native Customizer Live Updates**:
  - Fixed native ad disappearance on dynamic color selections by updating MethodChannel state without clearing active loaded ad instances.
  - Expanded `CustomNativeADStyle` to support title, body, button, tag foreground/background colors, radius sliders, and button gradient tokens.
  - Added optional `Key? key` parameter to `showNativeAd(...)` and `showCollapsibleBannerAd(...)` for instant subtree key identity updates.
- **Streamlined Library Exports**:
  - Exported all models, enums, constants, widgets, and singletons directly via `package:preload_google_ads/preload_google_ads.dart`.
- **Comprehensive Unit Testing Suite**:
  - Modularized unit tests into dedicated files under `test/`: `ad_commons_test.dart`, `banner_ad_test.dart`, `native_ad_test.dart`, `inter_ad_test.dart`, `rewarded_ad_test.dart`, `app_open_ad_test.dart`, and `preload_google_ads_test.dart`.
- **Showcase Example App Redesign**:
  - Streamlined navigation into clean top-level tabs: **Dashboard**, **Customizer**, **Native Feed**, **Banner Ads**, and **Ad Lab**.
  - Updated branding logo and app launcher icons across Android and iOS assets.
